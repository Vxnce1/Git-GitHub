# My Greatest Fear in Life

> My greatest fear in life is wasting the opportunities my family has sacrificed for me. 
> Their hard work and support have given me chances they may not have had themselves, and *I fear that by falling short of my potential, I may fail to meet their expectations and waste their sacrifices.* 
> This is my **number one** motivating factor, encouraging me to work hard and make the most of every opportunity I’m given. 

## Other fears that I have include...
* Snakes
   * *Ophidiophobia*  
* Being attacked during the night
* Making the **wrong** life choices and regretting them later
